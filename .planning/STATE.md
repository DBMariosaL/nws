## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Added a `src/cli.ts` wrapper so `bin/cli.js` can be emitted while keeping `src/cli/index.ts` as the command wiring entrypoint.
- Pack manifests use JSON frontmatter with command bodies and Claude frontmatter metadata for installer rendering.
